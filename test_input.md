Assessment of the Mother, Fetus, and Newborn
ASSESSMENT OF THE MOTHER
Pregnancies associated with perinatal morbidity or mortality are considered high risk. Identification of high-risk pregnancies is essential as they may be caused by maternal and/or fetal conditions. Conditions include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or excessive fetal growth, congenital anomalies, birth asphyxia and trauma, prematurity (birth at <37 weeks) or postmaturity (birth at ≥42 weeks), neonatal disease, or longterm risks of cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and chronic sequelae of neonatal intensive care. Ten to 20% of women may be high risk at some time during their pregnancy. Although some obstetric complications are first seen during labor and delivery and cannot be predicted, more than 50% of perinatal mortality and morbidity results from problems identified before delivery. After a high-risk pregnancy is identified, measures can be instituted to prevent complications, provide intensive fetal surveillance, and initiate appropriate treatments of the mother and fetus. A history of previous premature birth, intrauterine fetal
death, multiple gestation, IUGR, congenital malformation, explained or unexplained neonatal death (e.g., group B streptococcal sepsis), birth trauma, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, grand multipara status (five or more pregnancies), or cesarean section is associated with additional risk in subsequent pregnancies. Pregnancy complications that increase the risk of adverse
outcomes can be secondary to maternal or fetal conditions or both (Table 58.1). Neonatal complications include conditions caused by the placenta which tend to cause asphyxia and anemia, while disorders of the mother lead to problems such as electrolyte disorders or growth problems. Maternal medical complications associated with increased
risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality include diabetes, chronic hypertension, congenital heart disease (especially with right-to-left shunting and Eisenmenger complex), glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diseases (especially systemic lupus erythematosus with or without antiphospholipid antibodies), lung disease (cystic fibrosis), severe anemia (sickle cell anemia), hyperthyroidism, myasthenia gravis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, inborn errors of metabolism
(maternal phenylketonuria), acute infection (COVID-19), and malignancy. Obstetric complications often are associated with
increased fetal or neonatal risk. Vaginal bleeding in the first trimester or early second trimester may be caused by a threatened or actual spontaneous abortion and is associated with increased risk of congenital malformations or chromosomal disorders. Painless vaginal bleeding that is not associated with labor and occurs in the late second or (more likely) third trimester often is the result of placenta previa. Bleeding develops when the placental mass overlies the internal cervical os; this may produce maternal hemorrhagic shock, necessitating transfusions. Bleeding also may result in premature delivery. Painful vaginal bleeding is often the result of retroplacental hemorrhage or placental abruption. Associated findings include advanced maternal age and parity, maternal chronic hypertension, cocaine use, preterm rupture of membranes, polyhydramnios, twin gestation, and preeclampsia. Fetal asphyxia ensues as the retroplacental hematoma causes placental separation that interferes with fetal oxygenation. Both types of bleeding are associated with fetal blood loss. Neonatal anemia may be more common with placenta previa. Abnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid, resulting
in oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, are associated with increased fetal and neonatal risk. Oligohydramnios (amniotic ultrasound fluid index ≤2 cm) is associated with IUGR and major congenital anomalies (particularly of the fetal kidneys) and with chromosomal syndromes.
Bilateral renal agenesis results in diminished production of amniotic fluid and a specific deformation syndrome (Potter syndrome), which includes clubfeet, characteristic compressed facies, lowset ears, scaphoid abdomen, and diminished chest wall size accompanied by pulmonary hypoplasia and, often, pneumothorax. Uterine compression in the absence of amniotic fluid retards lung growth; patients with this condition die of respiratory failure rather than renal insufficiency. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (donor) and complications from amniotic fluid leakage also are associated with oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios increases the risk of fetal distress during labor (meconium-stained fluid and variable decelerations); the risk may be reduced by saline amnioinfusion during labor. Polyhydramnios may be acute and associated with premature labor, maternal discomfort, and respiratory compromise. More often, polyhydramnios is chronic and is associated with diabetes, immune or nonimmune hydrops fetalis, multiple gestation, trisomy 18 or 21, and major congenital anomalies. Anencephaly, hydrocephaly, and meningomyelocele are

associated with reduced fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid.
Esophageal and duodenal atresia as well as cleft palate inter-
fere with swallowing and gastrointestinal fluid dynamics.
Additional causes of polyhydramnios include spinal muscu-
lar atrophy and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, conjoined
twins, chylothorax, congenital pulmonary airway malforma-
tion, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, sacral teratoma,
placental chorioangioma, and myotonic dystrophy. Hydrops
fetalis may be a result of Rh or other blood group incompat-
ibilities and anemia caused by intrauterine hemolysis of fetal
erythrocytes by maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG)–sensitized
antibodies crossing the placenta. Hydrops is characterized
by fetal edema, ascites, hypoalbuminemia, and heart failure.
Causes of nonimmune hydrops include fetal arrhythmias
(supraventricular tachycardia, congenital heart block), fetal
anemia (parvovirus infection, bone marrow suppression,
nonimmune hemolysis, or twin-to-twin transfusion), severe
congenital malformation, intrauterine infections, congenital
neuroblastoma, inborn errors of metabolism (storage diseases),
fetal hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome, and pulmonary lymphan-
giectasia. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (recipient) also
may be associated with polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios is
often the result of unknown causes. If severe, polyhydram-
nios may be managed with bed rest, indomethacin, or serial
amniocenteses.
Premature rupture of the membranes, which occurs in
the absence of labor, and prolonged rupture of the mem-
branes (>24 hours) are associated with an increased risk of
maternal or fetal infection (chorioamnionitis) and preterm
birth. In the immediate newborn period, group B streptococ-
cus and Escherichia coli are the two most common pathogens
associated with sepsis. Listeria monocytogenes is a less com-
mon cause. Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum,
Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobic bacteria of the vaginal
flora also have been implicated in infection of the amniotic
fluid. Infection with community-acquired methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus must be considered for infants with skin
infections or with known exposures. The risk of serious fetal
infection increases as the duration between rupture and labor
(latent period) increases, especially if the period is greater
than 24 hours. Intrapartum antibiotic therapy decreases the
risk of neonatal sepsis.
Multiple gestations are associated with increased risk
resulting from polyhydramnios, premature birth, IUGR,
abnormal presentation (breech), congenital anomalies (intes-
tinal atresia, porencephaly, and single umbilical artery),
intrauterine fetal demise, birth asphyxia, and twin-to-twin
transfusion syndrome. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome
is associated with a high mortality and is seen only in monozy-
gotic twins who share a common placenta and have an arterio-
venous connection between their circulations. The fetus on the
arterial side of the shunt serves as the blood donor, resulting
in fetal anemia, growth restriction, and oligohydramnios for
this fetus. The recipient, or venous-side twin, is larger or dis-
cordant in size, is plethoric and polycythemic, and may show
polyhydramnios. Weight differences of 20% and hemoglobin
differences of 5 g/dL suggest the diagnosis. Ultrasonography in
the second trimester reveals discordant amniotic fluid volume
with oliguria/oligohydramnios and hypervolemia/polyuria/
polyhydramnios with a distended bladder, with or without
hydrops and heart failure. Treatment includes attempts to
ablate the arteriovenous connection (using a laser). The birth

order of twins also affects morbidity by increasing the risk
of the second-born twin for breech position, birth asphyxia,
birth trauma, and respiratory distress syndrome.
Overall, twinning is observed in 1 of 80 pregnancies; 80%
of all twin gestations are dizygotic twins. The diagnosis of the
type of twins can be determined by placentation, sex, fetal
membrane structure, and, if necessary, DNA analysis.
Toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia/eclampsia, is a
disorder of unknown but probably vascular etiology that may
lead to maternal hypertension, uteroplacental insufficiency,
IUGR, intrauterine asphyxia, maternal seizures, and maternal
death. Toxemia is more common in nulliparous women and
in women with twin gestation, chronic hypertension, obesity,
renal disease, positive family history of toxemia, or diabetes
mellitus. A subcategory of preeclampsia, the HELLP syn-
drome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelets),
is more severe and is often associated with a fetal inborn error
of fatty acid oxidation (long-chain hydroxyacyl–coenzyme
A dehydrogenase of the trifunctional protein complex).
FETUS AND NEWBORN
The late fetal–early neonatal period has the highest mortal-
ity rate of any age interval. Perinatal mortality refers to fetal
deaths occurring from the 20th week of gestation until the
28th day after birth and is expressed as number of deaths per
1,000 live births. Intrauterine fetal death accounts for 40–50%
of the perinatal mortality rate. Such infants, defined as still-
born, are born without a heart rate and are apneic, limp, pale,
and cyanotic. Many stillborn infants exhibit evidence of mac-
eration; pale, peeling skin; corneal opacification; and soft cra-
nial contents.
Mortality rates around the time of birth are expressed as
number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortal-
ity rate includes all infants dying during the period from after
birth to the first 28 days of life. Modern neonatal intensive care
allows many newborns with life-threatening diseases to sur-
vive the neonatal period, only to die of their original diseases
or of complications of therapy after 28 days of life. This delayed
mortality and mortality caused by acquired illnesses occurs
during the postneonatal period, which begins after 28 days of
life and extends to the end of the first year of life.
The infant mortality rate encompasses the neonatal and
the postneonatal periods. In the United States, it declined to
5.5:1,000 in 2019. The rate for Black infants was approximately
10.9:1,000. The most common causes of perinatal and neona-
tal death are listed in Table 58.1. Overall, congenital anomalies
and diseases of the premature infant are the most significant
causes of neonatal mortality.
Low birthweight (LBW) infants, defined as infants having

birthweights of less than 2,500 g, represent a disproportion-
ately large component of the neonatal and infant mortality
rates. Although LBW infants make up only about 7–8% of all
births, they account for more than 70% of neonatal deaths.
IUGR is the most common cause of LBW in developing coun-
tries, whereas prematurity is the cause in developed countries.
Very low birthweight (VLBW) infants, weighing less than
1,500 g at birth, represent about 1.5% of all births but account
for 50% of neonatal deaths. Compared with infants weighing
2,500 g or more, LBW infants are 40 times more likely to die in
the neonatal period; VLBW infants have a 200-fold higher risk
of neonatal death. The LBW rate has increased in recent yearswww.konkur.in

and is one of the major reasons that the U.S. infant mortality
rate is high compared with other large, modern, industrialized
countries.
Maternal factors associated with a LBW caused by prema-
ture birth or IUGR include a previous LBW birth, low socioeco-
nomic status, low level of maternal education, poor antenatal
care, maternal age younger than 16 years or older than 35 years,
short interval between pregnancies, cigarette smoking, alcohol
and illicit drug use, physical (excessive standing or walking) or
psychologic (poor social support) stresses, single parent, low
prepregnancy weight (<45 kg), poor weight gain during preg-
nancy (<10 lb), and being Black. LBW and VLBW rates for
Black women are twice the rates for White women. The neona-
tal and infant mortality rates are nearly twofold higher among
Black infants. These racial differences are only partly explained
by poverty; racism is an important factor.

Major Causes of Perinatal and Neonatal
Mortality
ASSESSMENT OF THE FETUS
Fetal growth can be assessed by determining the fundal height
of the uterus through bimanual examination of the gravid
abdomen. Fetal size can be determined accurately by ultra-
sound techniques. Ultrasound measurements of the fetal bipa-
rietal diameter, femur length, and abdominal circumference
are used to estimate fetal growth. A combination of these mea-
surements predicts fetal weight. Deviations from the normal
fetal growth curve are associated with high-risk conditions.
IUGR is present when fetal growth stops and, over time,
declines to less than the 5th percentile of growth for gesta-
tional age or when growth proceeds slowly, but absolute size
remains less than the 5th percentile. Growth restriction may
result from fetal conditions that reduce the innate growth
potential, such as fetal rubella infection, primordial dwarfing
syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities, and congenital mal-
formation syndromes. Reduced fetal production of insulin
and insulin-like growth factor I is associated with fetal growth
restriction. Placental causes of IUGR include villitis (congen-
ital infections), placental tumors, chronic abruptio placentae,
twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and placental insuffi-
ciency. Maternal causes include severe peripheral vascular dis-

eases that reduce uterine blood flow (chronic hypertension,
diabetic vasculopathy, and preeclampsia/eclampsia), reduced
nutritional intake, alcohol or drug use, cigarette smoking,
uterine constraint (noted predominantly in mothers of small
stature with a low prepregnancy weight), and reduced weight
gain during pregnancy. The outcome of IUGR depends on the
cause of the reduced fetal growth and the associated compli-
cations after birth (Table 58.2). Fetuses subjected to chronic
intrauterine hypoxia as a result of uteroplacental insufficiency
are at an increased risk for the comorbidities of birth asphyxia,
polycythemia, and hypoglycemia. Fetuses with reduced tissue
mass due to chromosomal, metabolic, or multiple congenital
anomaly syndromes have poor outcomes based on the prog-
nosis for the particular syndrome. Fetuses born to small moth-
ers and fetuses of mothers with poor nutritional intake usually
show catch-up growth after birth.
Fetal size does not always correlate with functional or struc-
tural maturity. Determining fetal maturity is crucial when
making a decision to deliver a fetus because of fetal or mater-
nal disease. Fetal gestational age may be determined accurately
on the basis of a correct estimate of the last menstrual period.
Clinically relevant landmark dates can be used to determine
gestational age; the first audible heart tones by fetoscope are
detected at 18–20 weeks (12–14 weeks by Doppler methods),
and quickening of fetal movements usually is perceived at
18–20 weeks. However, it is not always possible to determine
fetal maturity by such dating, especially in a high-risk situa-
tion, such as preterm labor or a diabetic pregnancy; fetal ultra-
sonography before 20 weeks of gestation provides an accurate
measure of gestational age.
Methods used to assess fetal well-being before the onset of
labor are focused on identifying a fetus at risk for asphyxia or
a fetus already compromised by uteroplacental insufficiency.
The oxytocin challenge test simulates uterine contractions
through an infusion of oxytocin sufficient to produce three
contractions in a 10-minute period. The development of peri-
odic fetal bradycardia out of phase with uterine contractions
(late deceleration) is a positive test result and predicts an
at-risk fetus.www.konkur.in

(flattened tracing resulting from fetal sleep, tachycardia, atro-
pine, sedatives, prematurity, or fetal distress). Periodic changes
of the heart rate relative to uterine pressure help determine
the presence of hypoxia and acidosis caused by uteroplacental
insufficiency or maternal hypotension (late or type II deceler-

ations) or by umbilical cord compression (variable decelera-
tions). In the presence of severe decelerations (late or repeated
prolonged variable), a fetal scalp blood gas level should be
obtained to assess fetal acidosis. A scalp pH of less than 7.20
indicates fetal hypoxic compromise. A pH between 7.20 and
7.25 is in a borderline zone and warrants repeat testing.
Fetal anomalies may be detected by ultrasonography.
Emphasis should be placed on visualization of the geni-
tourinary tract; the head (for anencephaly or hydroceph-
aly), neck (for thickened nuchal translucency), and back
(for spina bifida); skeleton; gastrointestinal tract; and heart.
Four-chamber and great artery views are required for detec-
tion of heart anomalies. Chromosomal anomaly syndromes
are often associated with an abnormal “quadruple test” (low
unconjugated estriols, low maternal serum α-fetoprotein lev-
els, high inhibin A, and elevated placental chorionic gonado-
tropin levels). Fetal genetic and chromosomal disorders can
also be detected by analyzing free fetal DNA that is present
in the maternal circulation. If a fetal abnormality is detected,
fetal therapy or delivery with therapy in the neonatal intensive
care unit may be lifesaving.
ASSESSMENT OF THE NEWBORN
The nonstress test examines the heart rate response to fetal
body movements. Heart rate increases of more than 15 beats/
min lasting 15 seconds are reassuring. If two such episodes
occur in 30 minutes, the test result is considered reactive (ver-
sus nonreactive), and the fetus is not at risk. Additional signs
of fetal well-being are fetal breathing movements, gross body
movements, fetal tone, and the presence of amniotic fluid
pockets more than 2 cm in size, detected by ultrasound. The
biophysical profile combines the nonstress test with these
four parameters and offers the most accurate fetal assessment.
Doppler examination of the fetal aorta or umbilical arter-
ies permits identification of decreased or reversed diastolic
blood flow associated with increased peripheral vascular resis-
tance, fetal hypoxia with acidosis, and placental insufficiency.
Cordocentesis (percutaneous umbilical blood sampling) can
provide fetal blood for Pao2, pH, lactate, and hemoglobin
measurements to identify a hypoxic, acidotic, or anemic fetus
that is at risk for intrauterine fetal demise or birth asphyxia.
Cordocentesis also can be used to determine fetal blood type,
platelet count, microbial testing, antibody titer, and rapid
karyotype.
In a high-risk pregnancy, the fetal heart rate should be
monitored continuously during labor, as should uterine
contractions. Fetal heart rate abnormalities may indicate
baseline tachycardia (>160 beats/min as a result of anemia,
β-sympathomimetic drugs, maternal fever, hyperthyroidism,
arrhythmia, or fetal distress), baseline bradycardia (<120
beats/min as a result of fetal distress, complete heart block,
or local anesthetics), or
The approach to the birth of an infant requires a detailed his-
tory (Table 58.3). Knowing the mother’s risk factors enables
the delivery room team to anticipate problems that may
occur. The history of a woman’s labor and delivery can reveal
events that might lead to complications affecting either the
mother or the neonate, even when the pregnancy was previ-
ously considered low risk. Anticipating the need to resuscitate
a newborn as a result of fetal distress increases the likelihood
of successful resuscitation.
The transition from fetal to neonatal physiology occurs
at birth. Oxygen transport across the placenta results in a
gradient between the maternal and fetal Pao2. Although fetal
oxygenated blood has a low Pao2 level compared with that
of adults and infants, the fetus is not anaerobic. Fetal oxy-
gen uptake and consumption are similar to neonatal rates,

even though the thermal environments and activity levels of
fetuses and neonates differ. The oxygen content of fetal blood
is almost equal to the oxygen content in older infants and chil-
dren because fetal blood has a much higher concentration of
hemoglobin.
Fetal hemoglobin (two α and two γ chains) has a higher
reduced beat-to-beat variability

affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, facilitating oxy-
gen transfer across the placenta. The fetal hemoglobin-
oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left of the adult curve
(Fig. 58.1); at the same Pao2 level, fetal hemoglobin is more
saturated than adult hemoglobin. Because fetal hemoglobin
functions on the steep, lower end of the oxygen saturation
curve (Pao2, 20–30 mm Hg), oxygen unloading to the tissue is
not deficient. In contrast, at the higher oxygen concentrations
present in the placenta, oxygen loading is enhanced. In the last
trimester, fetal hemoglobin production begins to decrease as
adult hemoglobin production begins to increase, becoming
the only hemoglobin available to the infant by 3–6 monthswww.konkur.in

A portion of well-oxygenated umbilical venous blood
returning to the heart from the placenta partially perfuses the
liver. The remainder bypasses the liver through a shunt (the
ductus venosus) and enters the inferior vena cava. This oxy-
genated blood in the vena cava constitutes 65–70% of venous
return to the right atrium. The crista dividens in the right
atrium directs one third of this blood across the patent fora-
men ovale to the left atrium, where it subsequently is pumped

the left ventricle. Venous return from the upper body com-

bines with the remaining two thirds of the vena caval blood
in the right atrium and is directed to the right ventricle. This
mixture of venous low-oxygenated blood from the upper
and lower body enters the pulmonary artery. Only 8–10%
of it is pumped to the pulmonary circuit; the remaining
80–92% of the right ventricular output bypasses the lungs
through ductus arteriosus and enters the descending aorta.

of vasodilating prostaglandins are elevated, the ductus arterio-

also responds to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis with vaso-
constriction, a response that may increase pulmonary vascular
resistance further. The ductus arteriosus remains patent in the
fetus because of low Pao2 levels and dilating prostaglandins.
In utero, the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle, pump-
ing 65% of the combined ventricular output, which is a high
volume (450 mL/kg/min) compared with that pumped by an
older infant’s right ventricle (200 mL/kg/min).
The transition of circulation, occurring between the
fetal and neonatal periods, involves the removal of the low-
resistance circulation of the placenta, the onset of breathing,
reduction of pulmonary arterial resistance, and closure of in
utero shunts. Clamping the umbilical cord eliminates the low-
pressure system of the placenta and increases systemic blood
pressure. Decreased venous return from the placenta decreases
right atrial pressure. As breathing begins, air replaces lung
fluid, maintaining the functional residual capacity. Fluid
leaves the lung, in part, through the trachea; it is either swal-
lowed or squeezed out during vaginal delivery. The pulmo-
nary lymphatic and venous systems reabsorb the remaining
fluid.
Most normal infants require little pressure to sponta-
neously open the lungs after birth (5–10 cm H2O). With the
onset of breathing, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases,
partly a result of the mechanics of breathing and partly a result
of the elevated arterial oxygen tensions. The increased blood
flow to the lungs increases the volume of pulmonary venous
blood returning to the left atrium; left atrial pressure now
exceeds right atrial pressure, and the foramen ovale closes.
As the flow through the pulmonary circulation increases and
arterial oxygen tensions rise, the ductus arteriosus begins to
constrict. In a term infant, this constriction functionally closes
the ductus arteriosus within 1 day after birth. A permanent
closure requires thrombosis and fibrosis, a process that may

Silver nitrate (1%) instilled into both eyes without being
washed out is an indicated effective therapy for the prevention
of neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, which can result in severe
panophthalmitis and subsequent blindness. Silver nitrate may
produce a chemical conjunctivitis with a mucopurulent dis-
charge and is not effective against Chlamydia trachomatis.
Many hospitals use erythromycin drops to prevent neonatal
gonococcal and chlamydial eye disease.

Bacterial colonization of a newborn may begin in utero if
the fetal membranes have been ruptured. Most infants undergo
colonization after birth and acquire the bacteria present in the
mother’s genitourinary system, such as group B streptococci,
staphylococci, Escherichia coli, and Clostridia. Antiseptic skin
or cord care is routine in many nurseries to prevent the spread
of pathologic bacteria from one infant to another and to pre-
vent disease in the individual infant. Staphylococcal bullous
impetigo, omphalitis, diarrhea, and systemic disease may
result from colonization with virulent S. aureus. Antibiotic
ointment, topical alcohol, or chlorhexidine may be applied to
the umbilical cord to reduce its colonization with gram-pos-
itive bacteria. Nonetheless, many newborn units recommend
dry cord care. Epidemics of S. aureus nursery infections are
managed with strict infectious disease control measures
(cohorting, handwashing, and monitoring for colonization).
Vitamin K prophylaxis (intramuscular) should be given
to all infants to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
Before discharge, infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine
and be screened for various diseases (Tables 58.4, 58.5, and 58.6).
New diseases are being added to newborn screening, including
lysosomal storage diseases and spinal muscular atrophy.
The Apgar examination, a rapid scoring system based on phys-
iologic responses to the birth process, is a good method for assess-
ing the need to resuscitate a newborn (Table 58.7). At intervals of
1 and 5 minutes after birth, each of the five physiologic parameters
is observed or elicited by a qualified examiner. Full-term infants
with a normal cardiopulmonary adaptation should score 8–9 at
1 and 5 minutes. Apgar scores of 4–7 warrant close attention to
determine whether the infant’s status will improve and to ascertain
whether any pathologic condition is contributing to the low Apgar
score.

immediately reduce pulmonary artery vasoconstriction by
causing smooth muscle relaxation. Remodeling of the medial
muscle hypertrophy begins at birth and continues for the next
3 months, resulting in a further reduction of pulmonary vas-
cular resistance and a further increase of pulmonary blood
flow. Persistence or aggravation of pulmonary vasoconstric-
tion caused by acidosis, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia,
polycythemia, asphyxia, shunting of blood from the lungs, or
pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia results in persistent pul-
monary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Failure to
replace pulmonary alveolar fluid completely with air can lead
to respiratory distress (transient tachypnea of the newborn).

(pH <7); seizures, coma, or hypotonia; and multiorgan dys-

or other factors listed in Table 58.8. Most infants with low
Apgar scores respond to assisted ventilation by face mask or by
endotracheal intubation and usually do not need emergency
medication.
About 80–85% of infants born at term will initiate spon-
taneous breathing by 10 to 30 seconds; another 10% will
begin respirations with stimulation. However, about 3% of
infants will establish spontaneous breathing only after posi-
tive pressure ventilation (PPV) while another 2% will require
endotracheal intubation and less than 1% will require chest
compressions and medications.

Resuscitation of the newborn is a process of assessment,
intervention, and reassessment. It begins with the initial steps
of providing warmth ensuring that the airway is patent and
open, clearing the airway of secretions (as needed), drying,
and providing gentle tactile stimulation. Observation of the
infant drives the resuscitation. The baby should be observed
for vigor and muscle tone, along with heart rate, and respi-
rations, including use of a pulse oximeter. If the baby is vig-
orous with good muscle tone, heart rate is above 100 beats/
minute, and breathing (unlabored), no further resuscitation
is needed. Alternatively, if the neonate is apneic or hypoven-
tilating and remains cyanotic, artificial ventilation should
be initiated. Ventilation should be performed with a well-
fitted mask attached to an anesthesia bag and a manometer
to prevent extremely high pressures from being given to the
newborn; initially 21% oxygen (for infants >35 weeks ges-
tational age) should be administered through the mask. If
the infant does not revive, an endotracheal tube should be
placed, attached to the anesthesia bag and manometer, and
21% oxygen should be administered. If 21% (room air) is
ineffective, the Fio2 may be increased to 100% oxygen; con-
tinuous pulse oximetry monitors oxygenation. The pressure
generated should begin at 20–25 cm H2O, with a rate of 40–60
breaths/minute. An adequate response to ventilation includes
good chest rise, return of breath sounds, well-oxygenated
color, heart rate returning to the normal range (120–160
beats/minute), normal end-tidal carbon dioxide, and, later,
increased muscle activity and wakefulness. The usual recov-
ery after a cardiac arrest first involves a return to a normal
heart rate, followed by disappearance of cyanosis and notice-
ably improved perfusion. An infant may remain limp and be
apneic for a prolonged time after return of cardiac output and
correction of acidosis.

lows the same systematic sequence as that for resuscitation
of older patients, but in the newborn period this simplified

ABCD approach requires some qualification (Fig. 58.2). In
the ABCD approach, A stands for securing a patent airway by
clearing amniotic fluid or meconium by suctioning; A is also a
reminder of anticipation and the need for knowing the events
of pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Evidence of a diaphragmatic
hernia and a low Apgar score indicate that immediate endo-
tracheal intubation is required. If a mask and bag are used,
gas enters the lung and the stomach, and the latter may act as
an expanding mass in the chest that compromises respiration.
If fetal hydrops has occurred with pleural effusions, bilateral
thoracentesis to evacuate the pleural effusions may be needed
to establish adequate ventilation.
B represents breathing. If the neonate is apneic or
hypoventilating and remains cyanotic, artificial ventilation
should be initiated. Ventilation should be performed with a
well-fitted mask attached to an anesthesia bag and a manom-
eter to prevent extremely high pressures from being given to
the newborn; 100% oxygen should be administered through
the mask. If the infant does not revive, an endotracheal tube
should be placed, attached to the anesthesia bag and manom-
eter, and 100% oxygen should be administered. The pressure
generated should begin at 20–25 cm H2O, with a rate of 40–60
breaths/minute. An adequate response to ventilation includes
good chest rise, return of breath sounds, well-oxygenated
color, heart rate returning to the normal range (120–160 beats/

minute), normal end-tidal carbon dioxide, and, later, increased
muscle activity and wakefulness.
C represents circulation. Concurrently, while assessing the
pulmonary status of the infant, heart rate is critical to assess. If
artificial ventilation does not improve bradycardia, if asystole
is present, or if peripheral pulses cannot be palpated, external
cardiac massage should be performed at a rate of 120 com-
pressions/minute with compressions and breaths given at a
ratio of 3:1 (3 compressions followed by 1 breath). External
cardiac massage usually is not needed because most infants in
the delivery room respond to ventilation.www.konkur.in

D represents the administration of drugs. If bradycar-
dia is unresponsive to ventilation or if asystole is present,
epinephrine should be administered. Intravenous (IV) epi-
nephrine (1:10,000), 0.1–0.3 mL/kg, should be given through

tube. However, when epinephrine is administered through

cardiac activity with poor pulses, it is important to deter-
mine whether there is a pneumothorax. Transillumination of
the thorax, involving the use of a bright light through each
side of the thorax and over the sternum, may suggest pneu-
mothorax if one side transmits more light than the other.
Breath sounds may be decreased over a pneumothorax, and
there may be a shift of the heart tones away from the side of a
tension pneumothorax.www.konkur.in

If central nervous system depression in the infant may be
due to a narcotic medication given to or taken by the mother
acutely, 0.1 mg/kg of naloxone (Narcan) can be given to the
infant intravenously or endotracheally. Before this drug is
administered, resuscitation should be followed carefully.
Naloxone should not be given to a newborn of a mother who
is suspected of being addicted to narcotics or is on methadone
maintenance because the newborn may experience severe
withdrawal seizures.
In babies of more than 35 weeks of gestation suffering
moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic injury at birth, induced
therapeutic hypothermia (33.0–34.0°C) for 72 hours has been
shown in clinical studies to be efficacious in reducing the
severity of brain injury. Brain hypothermia, whether induced
by whole body or selective head cooling, provides neuropro-
tection against encephalopathy presumably due to hypoxic
ischemia.
Physical Examination and Gestational Age
Assessment
The first physical examination of a newborn may be a gen-
eral physical examination of a well infant or an examination
to confirm fetal diagnoses or to determine the cause of various
manifestations of neonatal diseases. Problems in the transition
from fetal to neonatal life may be detectable immediately in
the delivery room or during the first day of life. Physical exam-
ination also may reveal effects of the labor and delivery result-
ing from asphyxia, drugs, or birth trauma. The first newborn
examination is an important way to detect congenital malfor-
mations or deformations (Table 58.9). Significant congenital
malformations may be present in 1–3% of all births.
Appearance
Signs such as cyanosis, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions,
and grunting suggest pulmonary disease. Meconium staining
Telegram: @medical_net
of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and
the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spon-
taneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and
apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the
nervous system.
Vital Signs
The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital
signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120–160 beats/
minute), respiratory rate (normal rate, 30–60 breaths/minute),
temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary
measurement), and blood pressure (often reserved for sick
infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be
measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether
growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific
gestational age.
Gestational Age
Gestational age is determined by an assessment of various
physical signs (Fig. 58.3) and neuromuscular characteris-
tics (Fig. 58.4) that vary according to fetal age and maturity.
Physical criteria mature with advancing fetal age, including
increasing firmness of the pinna of the ear; increasing size of
the breast tissue; decreasing fine, immature lanugo hair over
the back; and decreasing opacity of the skin. Neurologic cri-
teria mature with gestational age, including increasing flexion
of the legs, hips, and arms; increasing tone of the flexor mus-
cles of the neck; and decreasing laxity of the joints. These signs
are determined during the first day of life and are assigned
scores. The cumulative score is correlated with a gestational
age, which is usually accurate to within 2 weeks (Fig. 58.5).
Gestational age assessment permits the detection of abnor-
mal fetal growth patterns, aiding in predicting the neonatal
complications for large or small for gestational age infants
(Fig. 58.6). Infants born at a weight greater than the 90th per-

centile for age are considered large for gestational age. Amongwww.konkur.in

the risks associated with being large for gestational age are
all the risks of the infant of a diabetic mother and risks associ-
ated with postmaturity. Infants born at a weight less than 10th
percentile for age (some growth curves use <2 standard devi-
ations or the 5th percentile) are small for gestational age and
have IUGR. Problems associated with small for gestational age
infants include congenital malformations, in addition to the
problems listed in Table 58.2.
Skin
The skin should be evaluated for pallor, plethora, jaundice,
cyanosis, meconium staining, petechiae, ecchymoses, congen-
ital nevi, and neonatal rashes. Vasomotor instability with cutis
marmorata, telangiectasia, phlebectasia (intermittent mottling
with venous prominence), and acrocyanosis (feet and hands)
is normal in a premature infant. Acrocyanosis also may be
noted in a healthy term infant in the first days after birth.
The skin is covered with lanugo hair, which disappears by term
gestation. Hair tufts over the lumbosacral spine suggest a spinal
cord defect. Vernix caseosa, a soft, white, creamy layer cover-

ing the skin in preterm infants, disappears by term. Post-term
infants often have peeling, parchmentlike skin. Mongolian spots
are transient, dark blue to black pigmented macules seen over
the lower back and buttocks in 90% of Black, Indian, and Asian
infants. Nevus simplex (salmon patch), or pink macular heman-
gioma, is common, usually transient, and noted on the back of
the neck, eyelids, and forehead. Nevus flammeus, or port-wine
stain, is seen on the face and should cause the examiner to con-
sider Sturge-Weber syndrome (trigeminal angiomatosis, convul-
sions, and ipsilateral intracranial tram-line calcifications).

SECTION 11 Fetal and Neonatal Medicine
Congenital melanocytic nevi are pigmented lesions of
varying size noted in 1% of neonates. Giant pigmented nevi
are uncommon but have malignant potential. Capillary
hemangiomas are raised, red lesions, whereas cavernous
hemangiomas are deeper, blue masses. Both lesions increase
in size after birth then resolve over 1–4 years. When enlarged,
these hemangiomas may produce high-output heart failure
or platelet trapping and hemorrhage. Erythema toxicum is
an erythematous, papular-vesicular rash common in neo-
nates that develops after birth and involves eosinophils in the
vesicular fluid. Pustular melanosis, more common in Black
infants, may be seen at birth and consists of small, dry vesicles
on a pigmented brown macular base. Erythema toxicum and
pustular melanosis are benign lesions but may mimic more
serious conditions, such as the vesicular rash of disseminated
herpes simplex or the bullous eruption of S. aureus impetigo.
Tzanck smear, Gram stain, Wright stain, direct fluorescent
antibody stain, polymerase chain reaction for herpes DNA,
and appropriate cultures may be needed to distinguish these
rashes. Other common characteristic rashes are milia (yellow-
white epidermal cysts of the pilosebaceous follicles that are
noted on the nose) and miliaria (prickly heat), which is caused
by obstructed sweat glands. Edema may be present in preterm
infants but also suggests hydrops fetalis, sepsis, hypoalbumin-
emia, or lymphatic disorders.
Skull
The skull may be elongated and molded after a prolonged
labor; this resolves 2–3 days after birth. The sutures should be
palpated to determine the width and the presence of prema-
ture fusion or cranial synostosis. The anterior and posterior
fontanels should be soft and nonbulging, with the anterior
larger than the posterior. A large fontanel is associated with
hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, rickets, and other disorders.
Soft areas away from the fontanel are craniotabes; these lesions
feel like a Ping-Pong ball when they are palpated. They may be

a result of in utero compression. The skull should be exam-
ined carefully for signs of trauma or lacerations from internal
fetal electrode sites or fetal scalp pH sampling; abscesses may
develop in these areas.
Vaginal delivery or prolonged labor prior to a cesarean
section may result in a caput succedaneum, a soft edema-
tous subcutaneous scalp swelling that crosses suture lines,
or a cephalohematoma, a subperiosteal hematoma confined
within suture lines.
Face, Eyes, and Mouth
The face should be inspected for dysmorphic features, such as
epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, preauricular tags or sinuses,
low-set ears, long philtrum, and cleft lip or palate. Facial asym-
metry may be a result of seventh nerve palsy; head tilt may be
caused by torticollis.
The eyes should open spontaneously, especially in an upright
position. Before 28 weeks gestational age, the eyelids may be
fused. Coloboma, megalocornea, and microphthalmia suggest
other malformations or intrauterine infections. A cloudy cor-
nea greater than 1 cm in diameter also may be seen in con-
genital glaucoma, uveal tract dysgenesis, and storage diseases.
Conjunctival and retinal hemorrhages are common and usually
of no significance. The pupillary response to light is present at
28 weeks of gestation. The red reflex of the retina is shown easily.
A white reflex, or leukokoria, is abnormal and may be the result

of cataracts, ocular tumor, severe chorioretinitis, persistent
hyperplastic primary vitreous, or retinopathy of prematurity.
The mouth should be inspected for the presence of natal
teeth, clefts of the soft and hard palate and uvula, and micro­
gnathia. A bifid uvula suggests a submucosal cleft. White,
shiny, multiple transient epidermal inclusion cysts (Epstein
pearls) on the hard palate are normal. Hard, marble-sized
masses in the buccal mucosa are usually transient idiopathic
fat necrosis. The tympanic membranes are dull, gray, opaque,
and immobile in the first 1–4 weeks. These findings should not
be confused with otitis media.
Neck and Chest
The neck appears short and symmetric. Abnormalities include
midline clefts or masses caused by thyroglossal duct cysts or
by goiter and lateral neck masses (or sinuses), which are the
result of branchial clefts. Cystic hygromas (lymphangiomas) and
hemangiomas may be present. Shortening of the sternocleido-
mastoid muscle with a fibrous tumor over the muscle produces
head tilt and asymmetric facies (neonatal torticollis). Arnold-
Chiari malformation and cervical spine lesions also produce
torticollis. Edema and webbing of the neck suggest Turner syn-
drome. Both clavicles should be palpated for fractures.
Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest
wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pec-
toralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine
gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may
have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression
should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be
bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.
Lungs
Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate,
depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath
sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales
should not be heard after the first 1–2 hours of life. Diminished
or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax,
collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia.
Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumotho-
rax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung
is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders.
Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests
a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel
sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid

abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.
Heart
The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in
older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the
second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life.
Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in
PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary
atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the
delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these
murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus
arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small
ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper
and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries).
Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be
measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An
upper-to-lower extremity gradient of more than 10–20 mm Hg
suggests coarctation of the aorta.www.konkur.in
CHAPTER 58 Assessment of the Mother, Fetus, and Newborn
Abdomen
A normal liver may be palpable up to 2 cm below the right
costal margin. The spleen tip is less likely to be palpable. A
left-sided liver suggests situs inversus and asplenia syndrome.
Both kidneys should be palpable in the first day of life with
gentle, deep palpation. The first urination occurs during the
first day of life in more than 95% of normal term infants.
Abdominal masses usually represent hydronephrosis or
dysplastic-multicystic kidney disease. Less often, masses indi-
cate ovarian cysts, intestinal duplication, neuroblastoma, or
mesoblastic nephroma. Masses should be evaluated immedi-
ately with ultrasound. Abdominal distention may be caused by
intestinal obstructions, such as ileal atresia, meconium ileus,
midgut volvulus, imperforate anus, or Hirschsprung disease.
Meconium stool is passed normally within 48 hours of birth in
99% of term infants. The anus should be patent. An imperfo-
rate anus is not always visible; the first temperature taken with
a rectal thermometer should be taken carefully. The abdom-
inal wall musculature may be absent, as in prune-belly syn-
drome, or weak, resulting in diastasis recti. Umbilical hernias
are common in Black infants. The umbilical cord should be
inspected to determine the presence of two arteries and one
vein and the absence of an urachus or a herniation of abdom-
inal contents, as occurs with an omphalocele. The latter is
associated with extraintestinal problems, such as genetic tri-
somies and hypoglycemia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome).
Bleeding from the cord suggests a coagulation disorder, and
a chronic discharge may be a granuloma of the umbilical
stump or, less frequently, a draining omphalomesenteric cyst
or urachus. Erythema around the umbilicus is omphalitis
and may cause portal vein thrombophlebitis and subsequent
extrahepatic portal hypertension. The herniation of bowel
through the abdominal wall 2–3 cm lateral to the umbilicus
is a gastroschisis.
Genitalia
At term, the testes should be descended into a well-formed
pigmented and rugated scrotum. The testes occasionally are
in the inguinal canal; this is more common among preterm
infants, as is cryptorchidism. Scrotal swelling may represent
a hernia, transient hydrocele, in utero torsion of the testes, or,
rarely, dissected meconium from meconium ileus and perito-
nitis. Hydroceles are clear and readily seen by transillumina-
tion, whereas testicular torsion in the newborn may present
as a painless, dark swelling. The urethral opening should
be at the end of the penis. Epispadias or hypospadias alone
should not raise concern about pseudohermaphroditism.
However, if no testes are present in the scrotum and hypo-
spadias is present, problems of sexual development should be
suspected. Circumcision should be deferred with hypospa-
dias because the foreskin is often needed for the repair. The

normal prepuce is often too tight to retract in the neonatal
period.
The female genitalia normally may reveal a milky white
or blood-streaked vaginal discharge as a result of maternal
hormone withdrawal. Mucosal tags of the labia majora are
common. Distention of an imperforate hymen may produce
hydrometrocolpos and a lower midline abdominal mass as a
result of an enlarged uterus. Clitoral enlargement with fusion
of the labial-scrotal folds (labia majora) suggests adreno-
genital syndrome or exposure to masculinizing maternal
hormones.

Extremities
Examination of the extremities should involve assessment of
length, symmetry, and presence of hemihypertrophy, atro-
phy, polydactyly, syndactyly, simian creases, absent fingers,
overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, clubfoot, congenital
bands, fractures, and amputations.
Spine
The spine should be examined for evidence of sacral hair tufts,
a dermal sinus tract above the gluteal folds, congenital scoli-
osis (a result of hemivertebra), and soft tissue masses such as
lipomas or meningomyeloceles.
Hips
The hips should be examined for congenital dysplasia (dislo-
cation). Gluteal fold asymmetry or leg length discrepancy is
suggestive of dysplasia, but the examiner should perform the
Barlow test and the Ortolani maneuver to evaluate the stabil-
ity of the hip joint. These tests determine whether the femoral
head can be displaced from the acetabulum (Barlow test) and
then replaced (Ortolani maneuver).
NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT
The neurologic examination should include assessment of
active and passive tone, level of alertness, primary neonatal
(primitive) reflexes, deep tendon reflexes, spontaneous motor
activity, and cranial nerves (involving retinal examination,
extraocular muscle movement, masseter power as in suck-
ing, facial motility, hearing, and tongue function). The Moro
reflex, present at birth and gone in 3–6 months, is one of the
primary newborn reflexes. It is elicited by sudden, slight drop-
ping of the supported head from a slightly raised supine posi-
tion, which should elicit opening of the hands and extension
and abduction of the arms, followed by upper extremity flex-
ion and a cry. The palmar grasp is present by 28 weeks of ges-
tation and gone by 4 months of age. Deep tendon reflexes may
be brisk in a normal newborn; 5–10 beats of ankle clonus are
normal. The Babinski sign is extensor (upgoing). The sensory
examination can be evaluated by withdrawal of an extremity,
grimace, and cry in response to painful stimuli. The rooting
reflex (turning of the head toward light tactile stimulation of
the perioral area) is present by 32 weeks of gestation.
Special Conditions Requiring Resuscitation
in the Delivery Room
Cyanosis
Acrocyanosis (blue color of the hands and feet with pink color
of the rest of the body) is common in the delivery room and
is usually normal. Central cyanosis of the trunk, mucosal
membranes, and tongue can occur at any time after birth and
is always a manifestation of a serious underlying condition.
Cyanosis is noted with 4–5 g/dL of deoxygenated hemoglobin.
Central cyanosis can be caused by problems in many differ-
ent organ systems, although cardiopulmonary diseases are the
most common (Table 58.10). Respiratory distress syndrome,
sepsis, and cyanotic heart disease are the three most common
causes of cyanosis in infants admitted to a neonatal intensive
care unit. A systematic evaluation of these and other causes
of cyanosis is required for every cyanotic infant after prompt
administration of oxygen, with or without assisted ventilation.www.konkur.in

Life-Threatening Congenital Malformations
Various congenital anomalies can interfere with vital organ
function after birth (see Table 58.10). Some malformations,
such as choanal atresia and other lesions obstructing the air-
way, may complicate ventilation. Intrathoracic lesions, such as
cysts or diaphragmatic hernia, interfere with respiration. Other
malformations that obstruct the gastrointestinal system at the
level of the esophagus, duodenum, ileum, or colon may lead
to aspiration pneumonia, intestinal perforation, or gangrene.
Gastroschisis and omphalocele are associated with exposed
bowel on the abdominal wall. Omphalocele is often associated
with other malformations, whereas intestinal necrosis is more
common in gastroschisis.
Perinatal Hypoxia and Asphyxia
Whether in utero or after birth, asphyxia-caused hypoxic-
ischemic brain injury (encephalopathy) is the result of
reduced gaseous exchange through the placenta or through
the lungs. Asphyxia associated with severe bradycardia or
cardiac insufficiency reduces or eliminates tissue blood flow,
resulting in ischemia. The fetal and neonatal circulatory sys-
tems respond to reduced oxygen availability by shunting the
blood preferentially to the brain, heart, and adrenal glands and
away from the intestine, kidneys, lungs, and skin.
Metabolic acidosis during asphyxia is caused by the com-
bined effects of poor cardiac output secondary to hypoxic
depression of myocardial function, systemic hypoxia, and
