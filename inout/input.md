Chapter 302: Mechanical Ventilatory Support
Scott Schissel


INTRODUCTION
Mechanical ventilation refers to devices that deliver positive-pressure gas, of varying oxygen content, to patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure. Hypoxemic respiratory failure refractory to supplemental oxygen and requiring mechanical ventilation is most often due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt caused by processes such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sequelae of trauma or surgery. Hypercapnic respiratory failure is most frequently caused by severe exacerbations of obstructive lung disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); loss of central respiratory drive from acute neurologic events, such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or drug overdose; and respiratory muscle weakness from diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Mechanical ventilation may also be necessary if patients have an artificial airway placed (an endotracheal tube) due to poor airway protection, such as in coma or in the context of a large upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and vomiting, or due to processes leading to large airway obstruction, such as laryngeal edema. Finally, since mechanical ventilation can lower the work of breathing compared to spontaneous ventilation, it is a useful adjunct therapy for shock and multiorgan system failure.

PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION
Although contemporary mechanical ventilators use positive pressure to inflate the lungs, a patient’s response to pressure applied across the lung (transpulmonary pressure) depends on the elastic properties of their lungs and chest wall; the amount of pressure needed to inflate a lung is the same, therefore, whether applied positively via mechanical ventilation or negatively using the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. In ARDS, for example, lungs are “stiff” or poorly compliant and often require much more pressure to achieve a physiologic tidal volume (Fig. 302-1), which, over time, may lead to respiratory muscle fatigue. If a patient with ARDS is on mechanical ventilation and makes no spontaneous respiratory effort, using sedation and neuromuscular blockade, the amount of positive pressure needed to inflate the lung is equal to the negative inflation pressure required if the patient were spontaneously breathing; however, the work of breathing is removed on a ventilator, allowing for sustainable ventilation.

Mechanical ventilation can be lifesaving by restoring adequate oxygenation and correcting hypercapnia. Optimal application of positive-pressure ventilation, however, requires avoiding underinflation, which can cause cycles of alveolar recruitment and then collapse, and at the other extreme, alveolar overinflation (Fig. 302-2); collectively, these processes can cause ventilator-induced lung injury by barotrauma and volume trauma. Optimal tidal volume ventilation occurs along the lung pressure-volume curve where respiratory system compliance is greatest, or where the smallest change in applied pressure leads to the greatest increase in lung volume (Fig. 302-2, shaded box). To prevent too low lung volumes at end exhalation, where alveolar collapse occurs, the ventilator can be set to maintain a specified positive pressure at end exhalation, or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (Fig. 302-2, B. Optimal PEEP). Lower tidal volume ventilation (goal 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) can help prevent the end-inhalation, or “plateau,” pressure (measured just after flow stops at end inhalation) from exceeding 30 cmH2O; this approach minimizes barotrauma- and volume trauma–induced lung injury, especially in ARDS patients (Fig. 302-2, C. Protective ventilation).

MECHANICAL VENTILATION MODES
Mechanical ventilation entails controlling or monitoring the same basic variables involved in spontaneous, negative-pressure breathing, including respiratory rate, tidal volume (VT), inspiratory flow rate and time, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). In addition, PEEP is a variable specific to positive-pressure ventilation and set by the clinician. The mechanical ventilation mode determines how much control the clinician and ventilator have over these variables versus the patient; for example, assist control (AC) mode allows for essentially complete operator control of all variables, whereas pressure support (PS) permits the patient to control important variables, such as respiratory rate, VT, and flow rates (Table 302-1).

ASSIST CONTROL VENTILATION
AC allows the clinician to control nearly all ventilator variables and is widely used when patients cannot safely participate in their own ventilatory efforts, such as when deeply sedated or unstable from acute respiratory failure or other critical illness. Most AC ventilation is in volume control mode where the operator sets a specific VT and respiratory rate, thereby assuring a minimum minute ventilation (VE). In addition to the set rate, patients can get additional, fully supported breaths at the set VT by making an inspiratory effort, which is sensed by the ventilator and triggers the breath. The inspiratory flow rate is set by the operator; thus, a dyspneic patient may meet resistance on inhalation if their desired flow rate is higher than the set rate, possibly leading to patient distress and increased work of breathing. In AC volume mode, the operator also sets the PEEP and FIO2. Importantly, since VT is an independent variable in volume control (i.e., set by the clinician), the end-inhalation (or plateau) pressure is a dependent variable not controlled by the clinician but rather determined by the compliance of the lung. Inspiratory pressures must be monitored, therefore, to minimize barotrauma.

Although AC is often volume controlled, it can be used in a pressure control mode, also referred to as pressure control ventilation (PCV). The key difference between volume control and PCV is that an inspiratory (or “driving”) pressure is set instead of a tidal volume in PCV; thus, every time the ventilator delivers a breath, it raises the airway pressure to the set amount above PEEP until inspiratory flow decreases below a set threshold, therefore ending inhalation. Thus, the resulting tidal volume will vary depending on the compliance of the lung. In a sedated and paralyzed patient (making no respiratory effort), the pressure required to generate a specific tidal volume (x) using PCV should, in the same patient, be equal to the plateau pressure in volume control mode where tidal volume is set at x. Importantly, since lung compliance can change dynamically, tidal volume may also change with PCV; tidal volume and minute ventilation, therefore, must be monitored since there is no assurance of delivered ventilation volumes as with volume control. PCV is often used to limit peak airway and lung distending (plateau) pressures in situations where high pressure can cause harm, such as in ARDS or after thoracic surgery with fresh suture lines in the airways or lung parenchyma. Importantly, however, inspiratory flow rate and volume are dependent variables in PCV, unlike in volume control ventilation, and not set by the clinician. Spontaneously breathing patients on PCV can generate a relative negative pressure in the ventilator circuit, transiently decreasing the positive pressure below the set point; the ventilator responds by increasing gas flow until it restores the set pressure, resulting in higher inspiratory flow rates, a higher tidal volume for that breath, and importantly, increased pressure across the alveoli, equal to the absolute (negative) pressure generated by the patient plus the positive pressure set by the clinician (Fig. 302-3). Since mechanical ventilators do not routinely measure or graphically display the negative pressure generated by the patient, clinicians can be unaware of this additional transalveolar pressure and potential harm by volume and barotrauma; importantly, therefore, clinicians should monitor for increases in tidal volume on PCV.

PRESSURE-REGULATED VOLUME CONTROL VENTILATION
Advances in ventilator technology, such as flow and pressure sensors and microprocessors, allow for new modes of mechanical ventilation that meld the benefits of volume and pressure control ventilation. Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVC) is a fully supported mode of ventilation where the clinician sets a target tidal volume, as in volume control ventilation, but it allows a patient to make spontaneous respiratory efforts and vary inspiratory flow rates, as in PCV, enhancing patient comfort and ventilator synchrony. PRVC senses patient inspiratory efforts and delivers the least amount of positive pressure to achieve the targeted tidal volume; since patient efforts can vary and ventilator adaptation is not instantaneous, tidal volumes can vary from breath to breath on PRVC. In disease states where tidal volume needs tight control to prevent volume trauma, such as in ARDS, PRVC must be used cautiously if the patient can make significant respiratory effort.

PRESSURE SUPPORT VENTILATION
Pressure support ventilation (PSV) and PCV are very similar except there is no mandated ventilation, or set mechanical respiratory rate, on PSV, and ventilator support is entirely patient triggered and controlled. The clinician sets the FIO2, PEEP, and maximum inspiratory pressure. When patients make a negative-pressure inspiratory effort on PSV, the ventilator senses this pressure change and increases positive pressure to the set inspiratory pressure level, maintaining it until flow decreases below a set threshold (often ~20% of peak inspiratory flow); at this point, inhalation ends and pressure drops back to the set PEEP. The tidal volume on PSV is monitored but not assured, is determined by lung compliance, and depends on the patient’s sustaining an inspiratory effort. Tidal volume, minute ventilation, and respiratory rate, therefore, must be closely monitored on PSV to detect hypopnea/apnea and hypoventilation. PSV is often used when patients are less sedated and able to participate in respiratory work, such as when transitioning off mechanical ventilation or on a ventilator only for airway support.

NONINVASIVE POSITIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATION
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is historically referred to as positive-pressure ventilation and is delivered via a nasal or full-face mask at a continuous pressure (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) or at different inspiratory and expiratory pressures (bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]). Most current noninvasive ventilators, however, can function in full support modes, including volume control ventilation. NIV is particularly beneficial for acute respiratory failure where the underlying cause responds quickly to treatment, minimizing the need for prolonged mechanical ventilatory support. For example, in moderate acute hypercarbia (blood pH between 7.25 and 7.35) due to exacerbations of COPD, NIV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation and shortens hospital length of stay; more severe acute respiratory acidosis from COPD exacerbations (blood pH <7.2) generally requires mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. NIV can also be an important adjunct treatment for respiratory failure from acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, where interventions, such as diuresis and vasodilator therapy, can rapidly improve gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. NIV, particularly with volume support modes, is effective in managing chronic respiratory failure from restrictive lung diseases, such as severe scoliosis and respiratory muscle weakness, and in COPD complicated by chronic hypercapnia, where nocturnal NIV reduces COPD-related hospital admissions. Despite the technical innovations in NIV and expanding clinical applications, several important contraindications to using mechanical ventilation without a secure airway, such as an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube, include delirium, difficulty managing respiratory secretions, and hemodynamic instability (Table 302-2).

STRATEGIES TO OPTIMIZE GAS EXCHANGE ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION
ARTERIAL OXYGENATION
The optimal partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) during mechanical ventilation remain uncertain. Although tissue hyperoxia can cause oxidative injury, with some clinical studies of mechanically ventilated patients suggesting worse clinical outcomes with higher FIO2 and when PaO2 frequently reaches supraphysiologic levels, randomized studies comparing conservative oxygen delivery to a more liberal oxygen strategy have not demonstrated a clear advantage to conservative oxygen delivery. In ARDS, targeting a lower PaO2 of 55–70 mmHg (or SpO2 of 88–92%) versus a higher, but more physiologic, PaO2 of 90–105 mmHg (or SpO2 >96%) did not lower mortality, with adverse events being more frequent in the lower PaO2 group, including mesenteric ischemia. PaO2 and SpO2 targets, therefore, should be individualized to patients considering circumstances where even mild hyperoxia may be harmful, such as in recovery from ischemic brain injury and, conversely, where lower PaO2 levels (<55–70 mmHg) may be less optimal, such as in patients with ARDS and evidence of bowel dysfunction. Regardless of the approach, there is no evidence that a supraphysiologic PaO2 (>100 mmHg) has clinical benefit; thus, sustained hyperoxia should be avoided.

Arterial hypoxemia refractory to standard mechanical ventilation techniques is common in severe acute lung disease, especially ARDS. In general, if the FIO2 requirement is >0.6 or the PaO2:FIO2 ratio is <150 mmHg, additional interventions should be considered to improve arterial oxygenation. The application of adequate PEEP to prevent alveolar collapse during exhalation improves oxygenation by decreasing V. /Q. mismatch and shunt in areas of atelectatic lung. PEEP should ideally be set at the lower inflection point of the most compliant region of the lung pressure-volume curve (Fig. 302-2B). Although optimal PEEP may improve arterial oxygenation, achieving best PEEP has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes definitively and may have deleterious effects, including barotrauma with pneumothorax and hypotension from decreasing venous return to the right ventricle. Patients with refractory hypoxemia are often dyspneic on mechanical ventilation and make significant respiratory efforts dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite deep sedation, leading to poor ventilation and preventing optimal V. /Q. matching. In this context, neuromuscular blockade can be very effective at restoring effective mechanical ventilation and optimizing gas exchange. Although a necessary intervention at times, neuromuscular blockade does not improve overall outcomes in ARDS, can contribute to critical illness myopathy, and requires adequately deep sedation to prevent conscious paralysis; thus, it should be used only when necessary to treat refractory hypoxemia. In ARDS, diseased lung is predominantly dependent, and placing the patient in a prone position for extended periods can significantly improve arterial oxygenation. The role of prone positioning in other disease states is unknown and can be associated with adverse events unless performed by a trained team, such as dislodging endotracheal tubes and central venous catheters. Delivery of pulmonary vasodilator medications through the airway can improve perfusion to ventilated alveolar units, therefore improving V. /Q. matching and arterial oxygenation. Inhaled prostacyclins, such as epoprostenol, and nitric oxide are commonly used to treat refractory hypoxemia and can increase, on average, the PaO2:FIO2 ratio by 20–30 mmHg. Hypoxemia refractory to these multiple interventions may require consideration of transitioning to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), see below.

HYPERCAPNIA
Except for rare circumstances of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2), which can occur in the setting of fever, sepsis, overfeeding, and thyrotoxicosis, most hypercapnia is due to inadequate alveolar ventilation (VA) from an increase in the fraction of dead space (VD) (the volume of each breath not participating in CO2 exchange) relative to the total minute ventilation (VE), expressed as VA = VE (1 – VD/VT). Normal physiologic dead space is ~150 mL (~2 mL/kg), making the VD/VT for a 500-mL tidal volume breath 0.3. In acute respiratory failure due to ARDS, for example, VD may increase due to poorly perfused but ventilated portions of lung, while ventilation strategies lead to low VT; thus, a modest increase in VD to 200 mL and a low VT of 300 mL will result in a VD/VT of 0.66, a situation where hypercapnia may easily develop. Hypercapnia in the context of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg) ventilation for ARDS often causes acute respiratory acidosis that can be managed with higher respiratory rates, up to 30 breaths/min. Respiratory acidosis is often tolerated down to a pH of 7.2, so-called “permissive hypercapnia,” but progressive acidosis may require intravenous alkalinizing therapy (e.g., sodium bicarbonate or tromethamine) or accepting an increase in VT. In severe exacerbations of obstructive lung disease, COPD, and status asthmaticus, hypercapnia and acute respiratory acidosis are common despite mechanical ventilation, with average PaCO2 values of 65 mmHg and blood pH of 7.20 after initial endotracheal intubation. Poor alveolar ventilation is primarily due to dead space created by alveolar capillary compression in areas of alveolar overdistension and lung hyperinflation. Increasing minute ventilation by increasing the respiratory rate or tidal volume will, therefore, often paradoxically worsen hypercapnia by increasing gas trapping and VD/VT. The optimal ventilator strategy for severe obstructive lung disease physiology entails using lower respiratory rates, usually 9–12 breaths/min, and moderate tidal volumes (7–9 mL/kg) to maintain a minute ventilation of ~10 L/min; higher minute ventilation usually worsens hyperinflation and can cause barotrauma. To prevent dyspneic patients from driving hyperventilation, deeper sedation and occasionally neuromuscular blockade are necessary until severe bronchial obstruction responds to medical therapy.
